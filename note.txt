FPS matters more and more with increasing resolution
Weird stuff under 10fps
size 1 = data corruption
size 2-5 works
cargo build --release
720p had less crunchy sound, what about 144p ?
I tried again and I don't think resolution matters
Zip all the files

WHAT TO DO ON THE ISG:
Optimize:
    Find a tool for optimization
    Threads with HQ or set of designated frames ?
    Consider whether Data is still useful
    Choose a different codec ?
    What if I use a compressing codec ?
Add standard loadout

Realistic goals:
    1.Standard sets of options
        Fix weird bug with size 3 and empty bits
    2.Test with archives
    3.Benchmark
    4.Make executable
    5.Post to github and shill

After-project:
    Optimize (Find optimization tool)
    Encryption (Kind of unnecessary given archive passwords)
    Fix weird bug
    Code clean-up

Benchmark notes:
430 kb/s average, 4x size, optimal resistance
320 kb/s average, 11x-12x size, paranoid resistance
31.9 mb/s average, 1x size, maximum efficiency
(A lot of this time is just creating the file after the frames are made)

~8.5ms per frame, optimal resistance
~5.8ms per frame, paranoid resistance
~0.16ms per frame, maximum efficiency

Probably faster on paranoid because it has to read less ?

























Fix the weird bug (GIVED UP, DO LATER)
    Make blocks start from top right corner (Gives me even sizes)
    make it so differentiates between regular, 16:9 size and actual size
    Embedding or reading an imperfect causes bugs
    Not sure if a problem of embedding or reading
    Might be get_pixel
    It's not overlapping, I'm sure
    I noticed that every second frame seems broken
    It stops me from using anything other than 360p/720p
    Might have something built in
    Might be the length of file written in instructions
